<h5>2008-05-13: Networks ready for HD programming pile-up?</h5>

<p>High-definition television always has been viewed as a nice benefit of new TV
delivery technologies, but 2008 may prove to be the year HDTV becomes a
significant battlefield in the competitive war between telco IPTV players and
their cable TV foes. The race to supply consumers with the most HDTV channels
and hours of on-demand HD programming may have been sparked by Verizon
Communications, which announced late last year it would deliver 150 linear HDTV
channels by the end of this year. However, Verizon may have been responding to
more subtle HTDV upticks from cable TV and satellite TV firms.

<p>While providers continue to pile on the HD channels and programming hours, it
is worth wondering how an abundance of HDTV could affect network bandwidth and
provider set-top box offerings. With its FiOS network, Verizon claims to be
built for high volumes of HD programming, though it also primarily has MPEG-2
set-top boxes in circulation, much less efficient than MPEG-4 boxes at handling
that programming. Cable TV companies are in the midst of rolling out network
upgrades to better support growing HD traffic, and the analog-to-digital
transition will help.
